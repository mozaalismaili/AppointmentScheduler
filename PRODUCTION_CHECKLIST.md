## üîß Environment Variables to Set in Railway

### Backend Service
```bash
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000
DATABASE_URL=your-mysql-connection-string
DATABASE_USERNAME=your-db-username
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your-db-password
```

### Frontend Service
```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-railway-domain.com/api
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Project**
   ```bash
   railway init
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   railway variables set JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   railway variables set DATABASE_URL="your-db-url"
   # ... set other variables
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   deploy.bat
   
   # Linux/Mac
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Frontend accessible at Railway URL
- [ ] Backend API responding to health checks
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Authentication flow working
- [ ] Theme switching working
- [ ] Localization working
- [ ] All dashboard pages loading
- [ ] Appointment booking working
- [ ] Availability management working

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **CORS Errors**: Check backend CORS configuration
2. **Database Connection**: Verify DATABASE_URL format
3. **JWT Issues**: Ensure JWT_SECRET is set
4. **Frontend API Calls**: Verify REACT_APP_API_URL

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs --service appointment-scheduler-backend
railway logs --service appointment-scheduler-frontend

# Check service status
railway status

# View environment variables
railway variables
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway logs for error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure backend is running before frontend
4. Check database connectivity
